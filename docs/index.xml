<section name="About GXML">

<p>
GXML is a perl module for transforming XML. It may be put to a variety
of tasks; in scope it is similar to XSL, but less ambitious. GXML is
an outgrowth of gxml2html, my tool for converting web sites written in
XML to HTML output. gxml2html is now "just another application" that
uses the GXML engine to do its work.

<section name="About gxml2html">

<p>
gxml2html is a generic, template-based tool for converting XML to
HTML. It determines how to render XML based on templates the web site
designer creates. These templates are in standard XML syntax with HTML
tags, they may use other templates within them, and they support
variables which will be replaced with attributes from the document.

<section name="Documentation">

<p>
Documentation is mostly shared between GXML and gxml2html, but the
intro pages to the User's Guides are independent. Both are available
here:

<ul>
  <li>
  <b><a href="gxml2html-guide.html">Read the gxml2html docs</a></b>
  </li>

<p>
<b>Current GXML version: 2.1, uploaded May 22, 2001.</b>
</p>

<p>
GXML and gxml2html are provided in a single archive. The usual
procedure for installing Perl modules applies to GXML. GXML must be
installed before gxml2html will run.
</p>

<p>
This tool requires Perl 5, and the XML::Parser and File::Spec modules,
both available from CPAN. It should work on any platform which
supports XML::Parser. I personally test on MacOS X and MkLinux, and
I've had positive reports from people running on other Unixes and
Windows. If you find any problems, let me know. Without further ado:
