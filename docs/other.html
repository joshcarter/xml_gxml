<br clear="all">
<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>
This page covers most of "those other features" in GXML. I put the
features common to GXML and gxml2html at the top. I've also tried to
rank them in rough order of usefulness, but since I have no idea what
<em>your</em> particular needs may be, you should at least scan the
headings on this page to see if you find something interesting.
</p>





<br clear="all">
<h2>HTML Mode</h2>



<p>
<st>NOTE: this is always on in gxml2html</st>
</p>

<p>
GXML was originally used to convert XML to HTML, but later I decided
it was useful for other generic XML transformations. Thus, in GXML the
"convert to HTML" mode is off by default, but you can easily flip it
on. HTML mode affects the output as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Tags which have templates are stripped, leaving the content of the
template without the enclosing tag.</li>
<li>Single-tag elements are changed to HTML syntax.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As always, an example to demonstrate:
</p>

<pre>
    # source XML:
    
    &lt;!-- Let's say "photo" has a template --&gt;
    &lt;photo&gt;
      &lt;source&gt;dog.jpg&lt;/source&gt;
      &lt;caption&gt;Ugly Dog&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;/photo&gt;
    
    &lt;!-- here's a single-tag element, in XML syntax --&gt;
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    
    # output with HTML mode on:
    
    &lt;!-- (note that "photo" tag got stripped) --&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;img src="dog.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      Ugly Dog
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;!-- here's a single-tag element, (now in HTML) syntax --&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
</pre>





<br clear="all">
<h2>Tag Remappings</h2>



<p>
Say you want to map &lt;heading&gt; in your source file to &lt;h2&gt;
in the output (i.e. a standard HTML heading). You could do this via a
trivial template, but you can do it easier via a remappings hash
passed into GXML, or a gxml2html config file. First, for those using
the module directly, here's the format:
</p>

<pre>
    my %remappings = ( 'heading' =&gt; 'h2',
                       'subhead' =&gt; 'h3' );

    my $gxml = new XML::GXML({'remappings' =&gt; \%remappings});
</pre>

<p>
The hash format is simply the source tag as key, remapped tag as
value. You can provide as many remappings as you want. Now, if you're
using gxml2html, you can do the following in your <tt>.gxml2html</tt>
config file:
</p>

<pre>
    # sample remaps in .gxml2html
    &lt;heading&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;
    &lt;subhead&gt;    &lt;h3&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Note that remappings occur <em>before</em> template substitution, so
if you provide both a template and a remapping for a given tag, the
remap will run first and the template will therefore <em>not</em> be
applied. Also note that if you remap a tag to something that does have
a template -- e.g. if you had templates for h2 or h3 in the above code
-- the template for the new tag will be applied. Finally, you can set
the replacement to nothing, in which case the tag (and any enclosed
content) is dropped.
</p>





<br clear="all">
<h2>Attribute Collection</h2>



<p>
<st>NOTE: All features from here down are only accessible from the
GXML module; gxml2html does not have an interface for them.</st>
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure if this feature is brilliant or totally gratuitous.
(Maybe both?) There's a stripped-down class in GXML which just
collects attributes using GXML's attribute engine. Given how XML
allows you have two different styles of "attributes," i.e. real ones
in element start tags and "logical" ones (for lack of a better term)
which are sub-elements, I figured people may find a GXML-based
attribute collector useful. If nothing else, I've found it useful.
</p>

<p>
The concept is this: you specify the kind of element you're looking for
(i.e. its tag), and the attributes you want to collect. GXML's
AttributeCollector class returns a hash containing everything it
found. The hash keys are an attribute you specify. For example, let's
say you wanted to find all the "person" elements in the following XML
file, get their quest and favorite color, and key the result hash by
their name:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;person&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Bob&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;age&gt;42&lt;/age&gt;
      &lt;quest&gt;turn the moon into green cheese&lt;/quest&gt;
      &lt;color&gt;blue&lt;/color&gt;
    &lt;/person&gt;
    
    &lt;person name="Ned"&gt;
      &lt;quest&gt;make lots of money&lt;/quest&gt;
      &lt;color&gt;purple&lt;/color&gt;
      &lt;haircolor&gt;brown&lt;/haircolor&gt;
    &lt;/person&gt;
    
    &lt;container quest-default="eat potatoes"&gt;
      &lt;person color="red"&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Fred&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;/person&gt;
    &lt;/container&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The source code for using the collector would be:
</p>

<pre>
    use XML::GXML;

    # create a collector    
    my $collector = new XML::GXML::AttributeCollector('person', 'name', 
                                                     ['quest', 'color']);

    # collect from a scalar
    $collector-&gt;Collect($your-xml-here);

    # ...or from a file
    $collector-&gt;Clear(); # clear old data first
    $collector-&gt;CollectFromFile('your-filename-here.xml');
</pre>

<p>
The parameters, as above, are the element you're looking for, the key
attribute, and a array ref to the other attributes you want. If you
want to run the collector over several sources, call <tt>Clear()</tt>
inbetween to clear out the previous data. (Your config settings will
be preserved.)
</p>

<p>
The resulting hash for the above XML and code would contain:
</p>

<pre>
    Bob =&gt;
      quest =&gt; turn the moon into green cheese
      color =&gt; blue
    Ned =&gt;
      quest =&gt; make lots of money
      color =&gt; purple
    Fred =&gt;
      quest =&gt; eat potatoes
      color =&gt; red
</pre>

<p>
As demonstrated, all features of GXML's attribute engine are
supported. Both styles of attributes can be used in the same source,
and you can use default attributes. Note that templates will
<em>not</em> be applied by AttributeCollector. This class was designed
to run fast, so it doesn't use the template engine. If you need to do
this, I'd recommend using a callback on the end tag of the element
you're looking for, then running GXML and calling Attribute() in the
callback.
</p>





<br clear="all">
<h2>Callbacks</h2>



<p>
Callbacks allow you to run code at the start or end tag of any element
you specify. The end tag callbacks also allow you to control some
aspects of how GXML handles the element. Let's start with a simple
example:
</p>

<pre>
    my %callbacks = ( 'start:thing' =&gt; \&amp;thingStart,
                      'end:thing'   =&gt; \&amp;thingEnd);
    
    my $gxml = new XML::GXML({'callbacks' =&gt; \%callbacks});
</pre>

<p>
The above code would call the subroutines <tt>thingStart</tt> and
<tt>thingEnd</tt> whenever it saw the respective start and end tags of
<tt>thing</tt> elements. The format for specifying start and end tag
is prepending "start:" and "end:" to the name of the tag.
</p>

<p>
So what are callbacks good for? Start tag callbacks could be used to
keep track of elements, e.g. counting the number of a given element.
The end tag callbacks are somewhat more useful, since at that point
GXML has parsed the content of the element, so you can call
<tt>Attribute()</tt> to find attributes. End tag handlers can also
do some neat tricks based on their return value.
</p>

<p>
End tag handlers can return a combination of these values:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>discard</b>: Discards the element. This is how gxml:ifexists and
ifequal are implemented; they return discard if their expression is
not true.</li>

<li><b>striptag</b>: Strips the element's tag from the output but keeps
its content. The GXML commands return this if they don't return
'discard,' since their tags shouldn't show up in the output.</li>

<li><b>repeat</b>: Causes the end tag handler to run again. Your
callback will also get called again. (Beware of infinite loops.) This
is used by the gxml:foreach handler, but I'm not sure if anyone else
will need it. If you're going to use 'repeat,' I strongly suggest
studying <tt>ForEachStart</tt> and <tt>ForEachEnd</tt> in the GXML.pm
source code.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since you can have return multiple commands, you need to return an
array reference containing your values, even if you only return one
thing in it. For example, let's say you want to add a callback for
"thing" elements which only allows three instances of a "thing" in
your output. You can easily do this with the following callback
attached to "end:thing":
</p>

<pre>
    sub OnlyTakeThree
    {
        if (XML::GXML::NumAttributes('thing') &gt; 3)
        { return ['discard']; }
    }
</pre>

<p>
Callbacks are passed a reference to an empty hash they can store
things in if needed. This is only useful if you're using the 'repeat'
feature; it lets you save your current iteration state, for example.
Again, you're getting into pretty heavy wizardry here, so study GXML's
<tt>ForEachEnd</tt> closely.
</p>





<br clear="all">
<h2>Dynamic Attributes (addlAttrs param)</h2>



<p>
You can specify a callback for variables which GXML can't match. When
GXML looks up a variable, it will search upwards through the attribute
chain in your XML document, then call this handler if you specified
one, and if the variable is still undefined, it will search for the
"-default" value.
</p>

<p>
The syntax is simple: you get passed the variable name, and if you
know the value, you return it. For example:
</p>

<pre>
    use XML::GXML;
    
    my $gxml = new XML::GXML({'addlAttrs' =&gt; \&amp;Boberize});
    
    [...mainline code here...]
    
    sub Boberize
    {
        my $attr = shift;
    
        if ($attr eq 'name')
        { return 'Bob'; }
    }
</pre>

<p>
Now all &#37;&#37;&#37;name&#37;&#37;&#37; variables will be "Bob" if a name can't be found
in the XML source.
</p>





<br clear="all">
<h2>Dynamic Templates (addlTemplates param)</h2>



<p>
Dynamic variables are neat, but you can also go crazy with dynamic
templates. These are extremely handy if you have some data that
doesn't change, but some data inside that does change. For example,
you have a news page on your web site, and the overall layout is
always the same, but the headlines are pulled from a database and
constantly change. Using a dynamic template for the headlines list is a
perfect solution.
</p>

<p>
To add dynamic templates, simply pass in a hash that maps your dynamic
template names to the subroutines that create the content. (The old
style way of doing it, from GXML 2.0, is documented later.)
</p>

<p>
Here's some sample code:
</p>

<pre>
    use XML::GXML;
    
    my %templates = ('headline-list' =&gt; \&amp;HeadlineListTemplate);

    my $gxml = new XML::GXML({'addlTemplates' =&gt; \%templates});
    
    [...mainline code here...]
    
    sub HeadlineListTemplate
    {
        my $template = '&lt;headlines&gt;'; # start with root tag

        [...get headlines into @headlines array here...]

        # create XML for each headline
        foreach my $headline (@headlines)
        {
            # append headline to $template
            $template .= sprintf('&lt;headline&gt;&lt;link&gt;%s&lt;/link&gt;' .
                                 '&lt;title&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/headline&gt;',
                                 $headline-&gt;{'link'},
                                 $headline-&gt;{'title'});
        }
        
        # close root tag of $template
        $template .= '&lt;/headlines&gt;';
        
        # always return a scalar reference
        return \$template;
    }
</pre>

<p>
Then of course you can make a normal (static) template for
<tt>&lt;headline&gt;</tt> that formats the name and the link as you
like it. Viola! -- now you have a dynamic, database-driven news page.
</p>





<br clear="all">
<h2>Old-Style Dynamic Templates</h2>



<p>
This style of dynamic templates was in GXML 2.0. It's still around in
case anyone's already using it. This usually gets ugly if you have
more than a couple dynamic templates, so I recommend using the new
style (above) instead.
</p>

<p>
There are two subroutines required: one to check if a given template
exists, and another to get it. The check routine should be fast --
it'll get called often -- but the other will only get called once per
substitution where there isn't a template already on disk.
</p>

<p>
Here's some sample code:
</p>

<pre>
    use XML::GXML;
    
    my $gxml = new XML::GXML(
            {'addlTempExists'  =&gt; \&amp;CheckAddlTemplate,
             'addlTemplate'    =&gt; \&amp;AddlTemplate});
    
    [...mainline code here...]
    
    sub CheckAddlTemplate
    {
        my $name = shift;
    
        if ($name eq 'dyna-template') { return 1; }
        else                          { return 0; }
    }
    
    sub AddlTemplate
    {
        my $name = shift;
    
        if ($name eq 'dyna-template')
            # return value is a reference
            { return \'&lt;p&gt;hello there&lt;/p&gt;'; }
        else
            { return undef; }
    }
</pre>

<p>
The theory here is that your <tt>AddlTemplate</tt> subroutine may be
complicated; e.g. printing a bunch of hidden form data in a CGI app,
where the data you print changes depending on your source XML. Thus
addlTemplate is only called when strictly necessary.
