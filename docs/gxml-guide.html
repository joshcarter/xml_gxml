<h2>Welcome and Overview</h2>



<p>
Thanks for your interest in GXML. GXML is a transformation tool for
XML, allowing you to process XML code in many ways. It's like XSLT in
purpose, but much simpler to learn and get started with. While simpler
than XSLT, GXML has features powerful enough for many tasks, comes in
an easy-to-use package, and is highly extensible for special tasks.
</p>

<p>
These are GXML's high-level features:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Template substitution for any given element.</li>
  <li>Templates may be provided by user code or files on disk.</li>
  <li>Any part of the XML, source or template, may contain variables
      which will be substituted according to well-defined rules.</li>
  <li>Variable values may be: things embedded in an enclosing element's
      start tag, other elements in scope, sub-values of an in-scope
      element, or provided by user code.</li>
  <li>Element tags can have variables in them.</li>
  <li>Special commands allow conditionals and looping, e.g. "if
      exists," "if equals," and "foreach."</li>
  <li>User can specify callbacks for start and/or end of given tags.</li>
  <li>Element tags can be easily remapped to other things.</li>
  <li>XML syntax can be easily translated into HTML syntax.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running Test Files</h2>



<p>
There are several test files in the "test" directory of your GXML
distribution. Change into this directory and run a couple of the .pl
files. Try <tt>variables.pl</tt> to start, since that's the next topic
I'll cover.

<h2>Getting Down to Work</h2>




<p><b><a href="api.html">Object API</a>:</b> 
Creating and using GXML objects.
</p>



<p><b><a href="variables.html">Variables</a>:</b> 
Next, dig into variable substitution in its various forms.
</p>



<p><b><a href="templates.html">Templates</a>:</b> 
Templates are the power of GXML -- this is what makes it useful.
</p>



<p><b><a href="commands.html">Commands</a>:</b> 
Commands are a new feature to GXML 2.0, giving it the most-needed
features from XSL.
</p>



<p><b><a href="other.html">Other Features</a>:</b> 
There's lots of extra stuff you can do with GXML. This is where we
pick up the scraps.
