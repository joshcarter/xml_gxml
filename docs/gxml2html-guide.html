<h2>Using gxml2html</h2>

<h2>Welcome</h2>



<p>
Thanks for your interest in gxml2html. This tool uses the GXML engine
to convert a tree of XML source files into a matching tree of HTML
files, using templates and other GXML features for the XML->HTML
transformation.
</p>

<p>
Since most of the gxml2html features are actually GXML features, many
of the documentation pages are shared. This document covers the basics
of gxml2html and links to the other shared docs.
</p>






<h2>Running the Samples</h2>



<p>
gxml2html comes with example files and templates in the "examples"
directory. Looking at the "article" example, this is how the
directories are laid out:
</p>


<ul>

	
<li><b>article:</b> this contains the raw XML which the
	tool will process.</li>


	
<li><b>article-templates:</b> this contains the templates
	(obviously).</li>


	
<li><b>article-output:</b> this is where the resulting
	HTML files will wind up.</li>


</ul>

	
<p>
First, install GXML. (See the README file.) Next, to ensure that
gxml2html is installed and working properly, switch to the examples
directory and run:
</p>



<p><tt>
<b>&gt;</b> 
../gxml2html.pl --work=article --force

</tt></p>



<p>
You should wind up with a simple HTML file and images directory in the
"article-output" directory. Try the same for the scoping example to
see gxml2html's variable scoping rules in action. The inventory
example shows off the gxml:foreach command.
</p>






<h2>Configuring gxml2html</h2>



<p>
Here are the command line params and what they do:
</p>


<ul>

	
<li><b>--templates=directory:</b> changes the templates
	directory to <i>directory</i>. </li>

	
	
<li><b>--work=directory:</b> changes the work (source)
	directory to <i>directory</i>. </li>


	
<li><b>--final=directory:</b> changes the final
	(destination) directory to, you guessed it, <i>directory</i>.
	</li>


	
<li><b>--debug:</b> turns on lots of debugging messages. If
	you're having problems, email me a run of the program with --debug
	turned on.</li>


	
<li><b>--force:</b> forces all files to be processed.
	Normally files which have not been modified since the last time
	you ran gxml2html will get skipped. IMPORTANT: if you modify the
	.gxml2html file (more later) so that tag remappings are different,
	you'll have to use --force for the first run afterwards to ensure
	all files are updated.</li>


</ul>


<p>
You can also put configuration params in a file named ".gxml2html".
The syntax is the same as above, just without the leading "--" on the
configuration param. (See the included "sample_dot_gxml2html" file as
an example.) The .gxml2html file should either reside in the same
directory as gxml2html.pl, or in the work directory. In the latter
case, you could provide the work directory as a command line param,
and the rest of the configuration would be read from the .gxml2html
file. This is how I generate the HTML versions of this documentation,
in fact.
</p>






<h2>Documents, Templates, and Variables</h2>



<p>
Now we get into the meat of writing templates, using variables, and so
forth. The following pages go into detail on each topic.
</p>


<p><b><a href="variables.html">Variables</a>:</b> 
First, dig into variable substitution in its various forms.
</p>



<p><b><a href="templates.html">Templates</a>:</b> 
Templates are the meat of gxml2html -- this is what makes it useful.
</p>



<p><b><a href="commands.html">Commands</a>:</b> 
Commands are a new feature to GXML 2.0, giving it the most-needed
features from XSL.
</p>



<p><b><a href="other.html">Other Features</a>:</b> 
There's lots of extra stuff you can do with gxml2html. This is where
we pick up all the rest.
</p>







<h2>Other Notes</h2>



<p>
The work directory may contain a mix of .xml and other files. Only the
.xml files will be parsed; everything else will be copied. As such,
you can have images and whatnot in there, and these will get carried
into the destination directory unharmed. Also, the .xml source will
also get copied in case someone wants to grab the unmolested XML
instead of the HTML.
</p>

<p>
The work directory can be a tree of files. The directory structure will 
be mirrored in the destination directory.
</p>

<p>
gxml2html tries to be smart about only processing files which need
processing. Basically, if you modify a file, it'll get processed.
Also, if you modify a template, all XML files will get processed even
if they haven't been modified, since the template change could affect
the final HTML file. If you suspect that something is out of date, run
gxml2html with the "--force" option.
</p>

<p>
The XML::Parser module which provides the parser core for gxml2html is
very strict about proper syntax in the XML sources, and it will barf
on any errors. I consider this a feature, and intentionally let it
stop gxml2html so you can fix the error.
</p>

<p>
While the included sample documents are extremely simple, gxml2html
can (and should) be used in more ambitious ways. FWIW, the entire
multipart-mixed.com web site is written in XML and makes extensive use
of templates. To see the XML source for any HTML file, just change the
".html" part of the URL to ".xml", and then view the source.
