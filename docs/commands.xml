<section name="Commands Overview">

<p>
Commands are special XML elements that affect your output depending on
certain other elements. They are most often used in templates to add,
remove, or repeat parts of the template depending on what's in the
data file. Here's a quick overview of the commands available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>ifexists:</b> If a given attribute exists, or combination of
  attributes, then the stuff contained in the ifexists block will be
  included in the output.</li>
  <li><b>ifequals:</b> If a given attribute's value equals the value
  specified in ifequals, the block will be included in the output.</li>
  <li><b>foreach:</b> For each peer instance of an attribute, the
  block contained by foreach will be run, and variables asking for the
  attribute will get the current iteration's value.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's go through each command and demonstrate some ways to use it.
</p>

</section>

<section name="ifexists">

<p>
ifexists is the most straightforward: "if a given attribute exists,
regardless of its value, include my stuff in the output." Syntax is:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;gxml:ifexists expr="attribute"&gt;

    (stuff contained will only go into your output if the 
    attribute exists.)

    &lt;/gxml:ifexists&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Here's an example:
</p>

<pre>
    # In your source XML:
    
    &lt;quote author="Robert T. Mann"&gt;
    If I were a dog, would gnawing on shoes hold
    the same appeal it holds for me now?
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    
    # In your quote.xml template:
    
    &lt;quote&gt;
    <v>_BODY_</v>
    &lt;gxml:ifexists expr="author"&gt;(&lt;i&gt;by <v>author</v>&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/gxml:ifexists&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Thus, if the quote has an author, it will get (<i>by author</i>)
appended to it.</p>

</section>
<section name="A Detour to Boolean Expressions">

<p>
Don't be terrified if you're not a programmer. "Boolean expressions"
is just a complicated way of saying that you can combine attributes in
your ifexists command, as such:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;gxml:ifexists expr="author AND page"&gt; . . . &lt;gxml:ifexists&gt;
    &lt;gxml:ifexists expr="author OR book"&gt; . . . &lt;gxml:ifexists&gt;
    &lt;gxml:ifexists expr="book AND NOT page"&gt; . . . &lt;gxml:ifexists&gt;
</pre>

<p>
You can use AND, OR, and NOT freely in your expressions.
</p>

</section>
<section name="ifequals">

<p>
This is the same principle as ifexists, but the given attribute must
exist and equal a given value. Syntax follows:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;gxml:ifequals expr="attribute" equalto="value"&gt;

    (stuff contained will only go into your output if
    attribute equals the value.)

    &lt;/gxml:ifequals&gt;
</pre>

<p>
For an example, let's redo the dynamic template switching we saw in
the "Templates" chapter, section "Variables Within Template Names,"
this time using ifequals:
</p>

<pre>
    # document source file:

    &lt;document
        name   = "Semi-annual Worm Preservation Report"
        author = "Bob the Man"

        photo-align  = "right"
        photo-source = "worms.jpg"
    &gt;

    (document body text here)

    &lt;/document&gt;

    # document.xml template file:

    &lt;document
        name-default   = "Untitled Document"
        author-default = "Unknown Author"

        photo-align-default  = "none"
    &gt;

    <b>
    &lt;gxml:ifequals expr="photo-align" equalto="right"&gt;
    (formatting for right-aligned photo goes here)
    &lt;/gxml:ifequals&gt;
    &lt;gxml:ifequals expr="photo-align" equalto="center"&gt;
    (formatting for center-aligned photo goes here)
    &lt;/gxml:ifequals&gt;
    &lt;gxml:ifequals expr="photo-align" equalto="none"&gt;
    (formatting for no photo goes here)
    &lt;/gxml:ifequals&gt;
    </b>

    <v>_BODY_</v>

    &lt;/document&gt;
</pre>

<p>
It's arguable that we didn't actually improve things with this change;
it was simpler the way it was done before. But I'm sure there are some
good uses for ifequals regardless.
</p>

</section>
<section name="foreach">

<p>
foreach is the most complicated command, and potentially the most
useful. It lets you iterate over multiple values of an attribute.
Here's the syntax:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;gxml:foreach expr="attribute"&gt;

    (this block will get run once for each value of attribute.
    Variables in here calling <v>attribute</v> will get the proper
    value in each iteration.)

    &lt;/gxml:foreach&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Note that "multiple values" of an attribute implies the attribute must
be specified as its own element -- not one defined in a start tag --
since that's the only way you can have attributes that are peers with
multiple values. It's easiest to see in an example:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;number&gt;1&lt;/number&gt;
    &lt;number&gt;2&lt;/number&gt;
    &lt;number&gt;3&lt;/number&gt;

    &lt;gxml:foreach expr="number"&gt;
    I see number <v>number</v>
    &lt;/gxml:foreach&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This will print the "I see" block three times, with <v>number</v>
being 1, 2, and 3. Notice that all the numbers are peers of each
other. If there are numbers somewhere else in the source file, e.g. in
a higher-level element, they won't be noticed. The "expr" will look for
the <i>closest</i> match to itself.
</p>

<p>
Now let's do a more complicated example:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;person&gt;
        <t tag="name">Bob</t>
        <t tag="age">42</t>
    &lt;/person&gt;
	
    &lt;person&gt;
        <t tag="name">Ned</t>
        <t tag="age">24</t>
    &lt;/person&gt;

    &lt;gxml:foreach expr="person"&gt;
    I see a person named <v>person:name</v>, age <v>person:age</v>
    &lt;/gxml:foreach&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This time we use the "drill down" syntax for accessing member
attributes of the person elements. We'll get "Bob, 42" the first time
the foreach block runs, and "Ned, 24" the second.
