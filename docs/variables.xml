<section name="Basic Variable Substitution">

<p>
The syntax of a variable is as follows, for a variable called "name":
</p>

<pre>
    <v>name</v>
</pre>

<p>
How exactly the value of "name" is determined is somewhat complicated.
XML specifies a standard format for attributes of an entity, as
follows:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;entity
        name = "Fred"
        date = "July 4, 2034"
    &gt;

    (this is the content of the entity; "name" and "date" are
    in scope here.)

    &lt;/entity&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The way everyone's used to seeing XML attributes written, however, is
using enclosing entities, e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;entity&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Fred&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;date&gt;July 4, 2034&lt;/date&gt;
    &lt;/entity&gt;
</pre>

<p>
GXML supports both styles. Thus both of these work:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;entity name="Fred"&gt;

    name is <v>name</v>
    (will be "Fred")

    &lt;/entity&gt;

    &lt;entity&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Fred&lt;/name&gt;

        name is <v>name</v>
    &lt;/entity&gt;
</pre>

</section>

<section name="Variable Scoping">

<p>
This is easy stuff if you're used to programming. I'll tell you the
formal rules first, but you can skip to the examples if you like. The
following rules apply for determining if a attribute is in scope, that
is, accessible through a variable:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>For attributes declared in the start tag:
  <ul>
    <li>The start tag must <b>enclose</b> the entity where the
      variable is used. It does not need to be the immediate parent;
      the given start tag may be several levels up.</li>
    <li>If there are several possible candidates, the most closely
      enclosing one will be chosen.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For attributes that are sub-entities:
  <ul>
    <li>The attribute entity must be a peer of where the variable is
      used, or be enclosed by a common parent.</li>
    <li>If there are several possible candidates, the most closely
      enclosing one will be chosen.</li>
    <li>If there are several possible candidates <em>at the same
      level</em> (i.e. peers of each other), the first will be taken.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
It's probably easiest to see with an example. First, where attributes
are declared in the start tag:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;manager name="Fred"&gt;

        &lt;employee name="Bob"&gt;
            name is <v>name</v>
            (will be "Bob" here)
        &lt;/employee&gt;

        name is <v>name</v>
        (will be "Fred" here)
    &lt;/manager&gt;

    name is <v>name</v>
    (will be undefined here)
</pre>

<p>
Now for the case where attributes are entities themselves:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;manager&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Fred&lt;/name&gt;

        &lt;employee&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;Bob&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;Bo3b&lt;/name&gt;
            
            (multiple personalities, maybe?)

            name is <v>name</v>
            (will be "Bob" here)
        &lt;/employee&gt;

        name is <v>name</v>
        (will be "Fred" here)
    &lt;/manager&gt;

    name is <v>name</v>
    (will be undefined here)
</pre>

</section>

<section name="Bending the Scoping Rules">

<p>
I'm sure there are some CS hard-core types who would get infuriated
over this feature, but GXML will allow you to get around some scoping
constraints. You can "drill down," as it were, into entities which are
within your scope to get enclosed values which aren't. Again, this is
easier seen than described:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;manager&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Fred&lt;/name&gt;

        &lt;employee&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;Bob&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;/employee&gt;
    &lt;/manager&gt;

    name is <v>name</v>
    (will be undefined here because it's not in scope, but:)

    name is <v>manager:name</v>
    (will be "Fred")

    name is <v>manager:employee:name</v>
    (will be "Bob")
</pre>

<p>
Thus the syntax is using colons to indicate a drill-down into a given
entity. In practice I've only found this feature useful in conjunction
with the "foreach" command, but maybe you'll put GXML to some other
use (or abuse) that requires this.
</p>

<section name="Default Values">

<p>
Variables can have default values specified by "<tt>-default</tt>"
appended to their name. Default values will only be used once all
other rules for resolving a variable have been tried. Thus:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;org-chart name-default="unnamed person"&gt;

    &lt;manager name="Fred"&gt;

        &lt;employee name="Bob"&gt;
            name is <v>name</v>
            (will be "Bob" here)
        &lt;/employee&gt;

        name is <v>name</v>
        (will be "Fred" here)
    &lt;/manager&gt;

    name is <v>name</v>
    (will be "unnamed person")

    &lt;org-chart&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Default values are especially useful when using templates, since a
template can use many variables but also specify defaults, enabling
the user to only specify things that are different from the defaults.
