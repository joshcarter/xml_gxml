A mutant butterfly escaped yesterday from the maximum security ward of
the <a href="http://www.butterflies.org/">Butterfly Pavillion</a> in
nearby Westminster. Initial discovery was by a Ms. Sandy O'Conner,
when the butterfly -- now dubbed "Flyzilla" by local residents -- ate
part of the bumper off her 1974 Ford Pinto. Authorities were alerted
and quickly responded.

<quote>The thing turned by squad car over!,</quote> exclaimed a
much-distressed Sheriff Hogg when reporters arrived on the scene.
Twisted metal covered the scene as the enraged Flyzilla ripped apart
police cars, the swing set in a neighbor's yard, and four nearby
mailboxes. Only one injury was reported, that of a police officer who
tripped while running from the butterfly.

A rapid-response team was sent by the Butterfly Pavillion in an effort
to capture Flyzilla alive, but they arrived a moment too late. The
metal-shearing insect was accidentally eaten by a local dog named
Teddy. Teddy's owner, Mr. Robert Mann, commented <quote>I'm not sure
what everybody's so excited about. Teddy eats everything. Just
yesterday he ate part of the bumper off Ms. O'Conner's Ford
Pinto.</quote>
